# Children's App
This repository contains three components for a simple children's application built using React:

# RegistrationForm Component
File: RegistrationForm.jsx
Description: This component represents a registration form that collects information such as first name, last name, age, gender, and selected immunizations. It includes form validation logic to ensure data integrity before submission.

# ListView Component
File: ListView.jsx
Description: The ListView component displays a list of registered children in a block format. It allows users to click on a registration block to view detailed information about a specific child. If no registrations are available, a message is displayed.

# ChildProfile Component
File: ChildProfile.jsx
Description: The ChildProfile component renders detailed information about a selected child from the list. If no child is selected, it prompts the user to choose a child from the ListView component.
